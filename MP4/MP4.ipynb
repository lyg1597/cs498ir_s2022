    "\n",
    "* The affine model states that $y = Ax+b $ where $\\theta=stack(b,A)$ are the 8 model parameters stacked into a single vector (e.g., $\\theta = (b_1, b_2, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23})$).\n",
    "* The quadratic model states that $$y_i = \\theta_{i0} + \\theta_{i1}x_1 + \\theta_{i2}x_2 + \\theta_{i3}x_3 +  \\theta_{i11}x_1^2 + \\theta_{i12}x_1 x_2 + \\theta_{i13}x_1 x_3 + \\theta_{i22}x_2^2 + \\theta_{i23}x_2 x_3 + \\theta_{i33} x_3^2$$ for $i=1,2$. The first 4 parameters in this set of coefficients also exist in the affine model, but the remaining 6 multiply the order-2 monomials $x_1^2$, $x_1 x_2$, $x_1 x_3$, $x_2^2$, $x_2 x_3$, and $x_3^2$. The 20-parameter vector is then $\\theta=(\\theta_{10},\\theta_{20},\\theta_{11},...,\\theta_{13},\\theta_{21},...,\\theta_{23},\\theta_{111},...,\\theta_{133},\\theta_{211},...,\\theta_{233})$.\n",

    "To estimate the parameters, you will construct objective functions `affine_objective` and `quadratic_objective` that sum the loss over the provided dataset.  To minimize the objective function, use the [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) function.  I suggest using the 'BFGS' method and no more than 30 or 50 iterations.  Note that you will either need to write your objective function as a 1-parameter wrapper function over the optimization parameters `theta`, or to use the `args` argument to `minimize` to pass in the dataset.  Your code that calls `minimize` should input an initial guess `x0=theta0` and extract the results from the returned `OptimizeResult`.\n",

    "We're going to perform intrinsics calibration of the SR300 depth camera by pointing it at perpendicular planes.  The first step is to extract the points that make up these planes.  To do so, in this problem we will implement a RANSAC-based plane extractor.  To keep your algorithms running at a reasonable speed, it will be helpful for you to learn array addressing in Numpy; running for loops in Python code is much, much slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration color and depth images are stored in the `calibration/` folder, and they will be automatically loaded for you.  Specifically, we will be using the `depth_aligned_X.png` files.\n",

    "\n",
    "Implement a RANSAC algorithm under `extract_planes_ransac_a` in `planes.py`.  For `N` iterations, sample subsets of `m` points, fit planes, and examine how many inliers there are.  An inlier to a plane `(a,b,c,d)` is defined by $|(a,b,c)^T \\mathbf{p} + d| < $ `inlier_tolerance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will produce a naive implementation that outputs any inlier sets that are at least as large as `inlier_count`.   You will represent an inlier set using just a list of integers; the result from this function is a list of lists of integers.  The `fit_plane3` and `fit_plane` subroutines will allow you to fit these planes easily.\n",

In `extract_planes_ransac_c`, if a point can be an inlier for multiple planes, assign it to the one for which it is the best fit (i.e., the point-to-plane distance is lowest).  You might also modify the code to provide normals to your code, which you can use for even better assignments. \n",

    "## Problem 3: Intrinsic calibration\n",
    "\n",

    "### Problem 3.A\n",
    "\n",
    "In `depth_calibration.py`, implement the `mutual_orthogonality()` function to determine how close to orthogonal are the planes determined for each scan.  You will keep the point indices belonging to each plane (the `planesets` variable) the same regardless of the setting of `fx,fy,cx,cy`, but you will change the points themselves.  In particular, see lines 165-169 of `rgbd.py` to see how the points are affected by these parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure orthogonality may choose to use an absolute value of the dot product (i.e., $|\\cos \\theta|$), dot product squared, angular error ($|90^\\circ - \\theta|$), or angular error squared.  To aggregate, you can either sum or average.  In any case, the result should be minimized when the normals of all planes detected for a scan are perfectly at 90 degrees.  (Note that for scan 11, two of the planes are parallel -- you should not penalize them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the space below for written answers, describe the orthogonality metric you used and the method you used for aggregation.  Also, examine which of the scans produces the worst result(s), and check the visualization in `planes.py`.  Explain why those particular scans seemed problematic.\n",

    "Now, implement the `calibrate_intrinics_fxfy` function to optimize your metric only over the `fx,fy` variables, keeping `cx,cy` fixed.  Use the [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) function to minimize an objective function.  I suggest using the 'Nelder-Mead' method, which is a derivative-free method, and no more than 30 or 50 iterations.  Note that you will need to write your objective function as a 1-parameter wrapper function such that it accepts the optimization parameters as an array `x`.  Your code that calls `minimize` should input an initial guess `x0=(fx,fy)` and extract the results from the returned array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the space below for written answers, report the initial and final parameter values, and the initial and final objective function values.  Did this seem to converge to reasonable values?  Compare with the parameters set in `calibration/color_intrinsics.json` (note: we're not using `depth_intrinsics.json` because the depth images have been aligned to the color camera).\n",

In the space below for written answers, report the initial and final parameter values, and the initial and final objective function values.  Did this seem to converge to reasonable values compared to `calibration/color_intrinsics.json`?  (Note that the Intel Realsense library refers to `cx, cy` as `ppx, ppy`.)  Explain why or why not.\n",
